# Inspection Readiness Risk Signals

This document defines early documentation-level signals that may indicate inspection readiness risk.

These signals are derived from public regulatory observations and practical quality system experience.

AI techniques in this project are used only to surface potential signals. 
Final interpretation and decisions remain with quality and regulatory professionals.

## Risk Signal 1: Terminology Drift Across Quality Documents

**Description:**  
Inconsistent use of critical terms (e.g., batch, lot, validation, investigation outcomes) across SOPs, deviations, CAPAs, and change controls.

**Why it matters:**  
Terminology drift often indicates misalignment between teams and weak process ownership, which inspectors may probe further.

**Early visibility indicator:**  
Repeated rework or clarification comments related to wording rather than substance.

---

## Risk Signal 2: Recurrent Late-Stage Document Revisions

**Description:**  
Significant document changes introduced late in the review or approval cycle.

**Why it matters:**  
Late revisions suggest upstream process gaps and increase the risk of inconsistent explanations during inspections.

**Early visibility indicator:**  
Multiple version updates close to approval or submission milestones.

## Risk Signal 3: Rework Concentration in Specific Document Types

**Description:**  
Disproportionate rework observed in certain document categories (e.g., deviations or CAPAs).

**Why it matters:**  
This may signal unclear procedures, training gaps, or systemic process weaknesses.

**Early visibility indicator:**  
High comment density or repeated QC cycles for the same document type.

## Risk Signal 4: Inconsistent Rationale Across Related Documents

**Description:**  
Different justifications or conclusions presented across linked documents addressing the same event or change.

**Why it matters:**  
Inconsistent narratives undermine credibility during inspections.

**Early visibility indicator:**  
Reviewer comments highlighting misalignment between documents.

---

## Risk Signal 5: Documentation Reflecting Reactive Rather Than Preventive Actions

**Description:**  
Language that focuses on immediate correction rather than root cause and preventive measures.

**Why it matters:**  
Inspectors expect evidence of systemic thinking and preventive quality culture.

**Early visibility indicator:**  
CAPAs heavily weighted toward short-term fixes.

## Notes

These signals are not predictive of inspection outcomes.  
They are intended to support earlier visibility and informed human review, aligned with Right First Time principles.
