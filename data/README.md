This folder will contain publicly available FDA inspection data and synthetic examples.

# Data Sources

No proprietary, confidential, or company-specific data is included.

## FDA Form 483 Inspection Observations

Public FDA Form 483 inspection observations are used as a primary reference source for identifying
recurring documentation- and quality-system-related themes.

Form 483s represent inspectional observations noted by FDA investigators and provide insight into
areas commonly scrutinized during inspections.

---

## Scope and Selection Criteria

For this proof-of-concept, inspection observations will be selected based on:

- Public availability via FDA databases or archives
- Observations related to documentation practices and quality systems
- A limited, representative time window to support trend exploration
- Exclusion of company-identifiable analysis or benchmarking

The intent is to identify thematic patterns, not to evaluate or rank individual companies.

## Synthetic Documentation Examples

To demonstrate how similar techniques could surface early risk signals in real workflows,
synthetic (mock) documentation text is created solely for illustrative purposes.

These examples do not reflect real SOPs, deviations, CAPAs, or change controls.

---

## Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

This project is designed to:
- Respect data privacy and confidentiality
- Avoid reverse engineering or inference about specific organizations
- Support transparency and interpretability
- Reinforce human judgment as the final decision-making authority

---

## Limitations

- Public Form 483s may not capture full inspection context
- Observations reflect inspector findings at a specific point in time
- This project does not attempt to predict inspection outcomes

All findings should be interpreted within these limitations.
